                Our performance at work is influenced by our own level of
                expertise, experience, motivation, nature of the work,
                opportunities given by the organization and equally importantly
                by the social milieu in which we work. In order to grow and
                develop we recognize that feedback is essential so that we can
                improve our functioning along the lines that the organization
                desires. Very often this feedback is not available to us in a
                constructive manner. We also hesitate to ask for feedback for a
                variety of reasons. It could be because of a variety of reasons
                one, we generally associate all feedback with negatives, two, we
                do not know whom to ask and trust and three, most importantly we
                fear that it will somehow disturb the ideal image that we have
                built of ourselves over the years.
                <br />
                <br />
                If any, the only ever time we may get any kind of a feedback of
                this nature is during the annual appraisals. Today,
                organizations use several methods of providing feedback. One of
                the methods organizations are using to help us correct our often
                incomplete perceptions of ourselves and how others see us is the
                multi- rater feedback, sometimes also known as the 360°
                feedback. Before we go into the process and mechanics of the
                multi-rater system it may be just of interest to see the origins
                of the whole process. The origins of multi-rater feedback or
                360° feedback can be traced back, like most management
                practices, to military and wars.
                <br />
                <br />
                The US army was the first to introduce multi- rater feedback
                during World-War I while the Germans are credited for 360°
                feedback as they added subordinates to the feedback circle
                during the World War II. The first known adoption in a business
                organization was in the Esso Research and Engineering Company in
                1950s. Multi-rater feedback systems are considered more
                objective because they capture the perspective from several
                different stakeholders therefore reducing the impact of
                perception bias. The multi-rater feedback can be used for
                meeting any of the following objectives a. Leadership potential
                identification and development b. Performance reviews and
                appraisals c. Career Development and Succession Planning d.

                While 360° feedback and other forms of multi-rater feedback
                systems are growing in popularity,there are still several
                hitches making the ride far from smooth and sometimes even
                ineffective. The most common problems faced when implementing a
                360° feedback process are - Firstly it is a time consuming
                process. Secondly due to the Hierarchical nature of
                organizations, there is hesitancy to give feedback to seniors
                and colleagues. Thirdly, there is anxiety associated with
                reports being linked to performance appraisals and the lack of
                follow up or action after the feedback reports have been
                generated.
                <br />
                <br />
                This brings us to the question, as to how is a 360 deg process
                rolled out. Often 360° feedback is not undertaken as the
                pen-paper exercise is elaborate, time consuming and extremely
                complex in terms of managing data and also because of
                confidentiality issues involved. The other alternative which has
                now emerged and often deployed is IT enabled multi rater
                feedback processes. Though there are number of tools and
                packages that are available for commercial use for this purpose,
                they often do not provision for the following -&gt;
                <br />
                <br />
                a) Wide range of questionnaires and databanks with competencies
                and elements from which the trainer/coach can choose and even
                customize to suit their specific requirements
                <br />
                b) Context specific elements change leadership is vastly
                different from say, servant leadership and ability to map each
                of these requires a different set of questions.
                <br />
                c) A easy to use interface which allows for grouping of
                individuals who are to rate a given person
                <br />
                d) Easy to understand, yet comprehensive reports which can be
                customized based on need a training program need is different
                from that for PMS or that for a coaching session
                <br />
                e) Last but not the least, a good indicative development road
                map, which will enable the individual to develop A 360° feedback
                tool packaged along the above lines, would be an attractive
                proposition for a trainer/coach and organizations and used
                strategically can reap rich dividends for employees and in the
                long run the organizations too.

                Now that we have agreed Professionalism is a Habit and a
                continuous process (our article on 360o the Key to
                Professionalism), where exactly does the journey to
                Professionalism begin? While there are several aspects and
                facets to Professionalism, there are a few behaviors considered
                core the bedrock, so to speak. People who work are so used to
                these that often the First timers at work stick out because they
                are lacking. Lets take a closer look at these behaviors
                <br />
                <br />
                1. Team Work At work, it is vital to work in constant harmony
                with others towards a common goal. Students work solo, their
                goal is to maximize their own rank or score. Very few colleges
                have created curriculum that encourages team-work on an everyday
                basis, fewer still have cracked the code to consistently
                evaluating Team Behavior.
                <br />
                <br />
                2. Adaptability and Dependability When a Student does not match
                up to the requirements due to pressure or other reasons; most of
                the time, only he pays for it with marks/grades. At work,
                however, the costs are higher - the Team and the Organization
                pay too. A Professional has to be able to be able to adapt to
                any situation and produce good results.
                <br />
                <br />
                3. Communication Skills What one says and How one says it has a
                huge weightage in how one is perceived. Communication has a
                scope that goes beyond just the Language skills. A Professional
                must be able to communicate with clarity, be brief, polite and
                assertive. The transition from writing answers to structuring
                effective e-mails is often tricky for the un-initiated.
                <br />
                <br />
                4. Emotional Stability Students have the luxury of choosing to
                communicate and often even work with people who fall in their
                comfort zones, once they enter the Corporate, this vanishes. A
                professional is expected to work with everyone in the team. It
                is crucial that he is able to manage his emotions and separate
                feelings from work. The era of the world pampering him comes to
                an end and he has to be able to balance his actions and deliver
                results.
                <br />
                <br />
                5. The Learning Attitude It seems logical that a Professional,
                who was a student not long back, would find it the easiest to
                Learn. However, for most of us, end of college also means end of
                learning and a job is associated purely work. A student must be
                able to develop and maintain a Learning approach to stay up to
                date and relevant.
                <br />
                <br />
                6. Self-Leadership A new professional must demonstrate
                self-reliance, confidence and enthusiasm to be considered an
                independent employee with a potential to grow. Ability to handle
                stress and manage oneself well is crucial to contribute to team
                goals and cohesiveness.
                <br />
                <br />
                7. Ability to Analyze The ability to look at a problem with the
                objective of understanding it and finding a solution is priced
                highly among professional. The Colleges must evaluate and train
                Students on these basic behaviors to prepare them for their
                first years as Professionals.

                Some Hard Hitting Facts Different international studies have
                found that companies end up investing huge monies on development
                of soft skills. Analyst firms, such as Bersin & Associates, have
                found similar results showing that organizations tend to spend
                at least 20-25% of their training budgets on soft skills
                initiatives. India too has seen similar tendencies with only
                around 10% of students found to be employable - 2013 study by
                Assocham (Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India)
                & 2012 study by Aspiring Minds.

                <br />
                It is time for all education institutes, to sit up and ask why
                the modern day professional is ill-equipped when it comes to the
                most basic of the skills. Communication is something we start
                practicing even as kids; inter-personal skills are a must for
                all the games we played as children. Then why do most of our
                professionals lack even in such basic areas? The question the
                is: Why is he still not professional enough? A Wake-up Call As
                individuals and education systems we are trained to chase after
                Numbers. We are hard-wired to look at only the limited visible
                aspects of Development - the ranks and percentages. In the race
                to be Numero Uno, we lose focus of all the other things that
                contribute to overall development the softer aspects, the
                behavioral skills.It is time to hit the pause button and
                <br />
                <br />
                analyze objectively what we are doing to groom students and
                where we are still falling behind. Some Good News Industry
                interface is now going beyond just guest lectures at premiere
                Institutes. Today Colleges are attempting to provide quality
                education by tying up with Organizations to design course
                curriculum specific for the industry there is the ICICI tie up
                with ITM University and with TVS TM Training institute, the IBM
                collaboration with Baddi University to name a few.
                <br />
                <br />
                This interface needs to now grow, having a communication channel
                between the Seeker of Talent (the Industry) and the Talent
                Suppliers (The Colleges) is vital so that the Talent is also
                skill ready. This will help the Industry reduce the time and
                money invested on grooming and also the Colleges benefit as they
                focus on what is really needed instead of providing the Jack of
                all Trades approach to Learning. Extending this Collaboration
                What is needed today is that the Industries and the Colleges
                further blur out the boundaries they have drawn around them. It
                is time to move from Evaluation to Feedback. Some of the best
                practices must be shared and implemented at the Education level
                itself to cement the expected behavioral competencies. Foremost
                amongst the techniques to be adopted is the 360° Feedback, which
                can help the student to get feedback from people who know him
                well, on competencies that he needs to succeed in his career.
                This tool is commonly used to assess managers and prepare for
                their development. A student can benefit greatly if this is
                initiated early.

                and soul of any Survey is Questionnaire. The survey is conducted
                through a questionnaire to elicit the responses from the
                employees. The construction of the questionnaire from this angle
                assumes significance and a tremendous amount of effort need to
                be put in to frame the statements related to employee engagement

                Given below are the steps structures the survey questionnaire-
                Purpose of the survey- To start designing the questionnaire, it
                has to be based on the objective or the need for why the survey
                is being conducted. Take into consideration what the
                organization wants as the results from the survey and
                accordingly prepare the questionnaire. The Questionnaire should
                cover the purpose of the Survey to get the desired results.
                Choosing the mode of survey- Survey is usually done in three
                types- face to face interviews or Quantitative and Qualitative
                questionnaire. It is advisable to combine all the three in the
                survey to get the accurate results as all the information cannot
                be extracted using a single method. Number of questions to be
                covered- Make sure that the number of questions are neither too
                many or too less. The number of questions should be adequate
                enough to get the output from the feedback. Structure-The
                structure of the questionnaire should start with an instruction
                note followed by quantitative and qualitative questions. The
                note should contain information on the purpose of the survey
                (why the organization is initiating the survey) and procedure on
                how to go about to complete it.

                Drafting the Questions- The questions asked should be in cover
                all the parameters of the survey and are of same importance to
                all the participants participating in the survey. The language
                used should be simple, short and easily understandable. Always
                avoid using complicated words. The questions should follow a
                logical sequence and avoid asking leading questions. Never
                combine two questions in a single one. It might have two
                conflicting responses, leaving the participant confused. Frame
                the questions in a way that will lead to the objective of the
                survey. When the survey includes blue collar employees, language
                could become a major issue-in such cases the statements needs to
                translated into the vernacular Rating Scale- It is important to
                use an appropriate rating scale which will eliminate bias in the
                response of the participants. The scale has to chosen properly
                which will force the participants to come with most genuine
                opinion. Test Run-Before you start initiating the survey, trail
                run it over a few people, to know if the language and the logic
                are understood. The above tips would help you to design your
                survey better.
